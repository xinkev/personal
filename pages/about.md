Hi, I'm Kevin, an experienced software developer with a strong focus on Android development for over four years. More recently, I've been diving into the world of frontend development, where I've spent the last 5-6 months working with Typescript, React, and at times, TailwindCSS. My aim is to build simple, effective, and user-friendly digital solutions.
